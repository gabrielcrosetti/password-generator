## Summary 

The password generator is activated by clicking on the "Generate Password" button. The password generation process then begins by presenting prompts, alerts, and confirms in which the user will determine which characteristics they will like in their password such as password length, inclusion of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. After the user has entered their criteria in correctly, a generated password will be presented that matches their desired criteria.
